# Furtherance
Furtherance is a time tracking app.
It allows you to track time spent on different activities without worrying about your data being captured and sold.

## Features

* All tasks have a name. Optionally they can also have a project, tags, and an hourly rate.
* History is grouped by name and date.
* Tasks can be edited after they are created and while the timer is running.
* Settings to customize the view and defaults to your liking.
* Features can be added! Just open an issue.

## Getting Started
